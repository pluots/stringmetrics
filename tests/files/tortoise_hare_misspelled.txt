A Hare was mking fun of the Tortoise one day for being so slow.

Do you ever get anywhere? he asked with a mocking laugh.

Yes, replied the Tortoise, and I get there sooner than you think. I'll
run you a race and prove it.

The Hare was much amused at the iea of running a race with the Tortise,
but for the fun of the thing he agreed. So the Fox, who had consented to
act as judge, maarked the distance and started the runners off.

The Hare was soon far out of sight, and to make the Tortoise feel very
deeply how ridiculous it was for him to try a race with a Hare, he lay
down beside the course to take a nap until the Tortoise should catch up.

The Tortoise meanwhile kept going sloly but steadily, and, after a time,
passed the place where the Hare was sleeping. But the Hare slept on very
peacefully; and when at last he did wake up, the Tortoise was near the goal.
The Hare now ran his swiftest, but he could not overtaake the Tortoise
in time.
