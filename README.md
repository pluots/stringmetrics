# Stringmetrics

This is a Rust library for approximate string matching that implements simple
algorithms such has Hamming distance, Levenshtein distance, Jaccard similarity,
and more.

In addition to the basic levenshtein algorithm, it includes a weighted algorithm
that allows specifying costs of insertions, deletions, and substitutions, as
well as a maximum limit for optimization.
