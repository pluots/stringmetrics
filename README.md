# Stringmetrics

This is a Rust library for approximate string matching that implements simple
algorithms such has Hamming distance, Levenshtein distance, Jaccard similarity,
and more, as well as a competent spellchecker that handles Hunspell
dictionaries.

This package comes with a library for programatic use, as well as a command line
interface. The library is usable via WASM.

## Stringmetric Algorithms

One of the main purposes of this library is to provide a variety of string
metric functions. These include a few Levenshtein implementations (including
limit/max, weighted, and generic), Jaccard index, and a Hamming implementation.
These are all found in the `algorithms` module.


## Spellcheck

This is a spellchecker written completely in Rust. While maintaining
compatibility with the venerable Hunspell dictionary format, it does not rely on
Hunspell or any other underlying checker.

Spellcheck functionality is found in the `spellcheck` module.

### Functionality

NOTE: The spellcheck portion of this project is still under development.
Completed and future planned support include:

- [x] Basic prefix/sufix dictionary files
- [ ] Forbidden word handling
- [ ]
- [ ] Morphological/Phonetic handling

### Performance

In general, this program has been shown to be quite fast. On an average laptop,
benchmarks give approximately 40-50 ns per word. This is fast enough to
spellcheck the entire million words of the Harry Potter series in about 40 ms.

In fact, it actually beats Hunspell in a simple spellcheck test on a very large
file. There is no guarantee that this performance will stay however, after
adding fuller features.

```bash
hunspell -d dictionaries/en -l < tests/files/odyssey.txt > /dev/null
